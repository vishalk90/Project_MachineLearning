# Machine Learning Final Project
* Used Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotype, containing 29623 SNPs (total features) & 8000 individual data points as a Train_Dataset for training the Model. Wrote a Python code to classify the Test_Data of 2000 different data points.
Applied F-Score Algorithm for feature selection. Able to select 14 best features from total 29623. Significantly reduced code execution time.
Used HingeLoss classifier for classifying the Test_Data. Able to increase the prediction accuracy from 59% to 67%.

* Please check the 'SNP_FinalProject.py' script for final copy of the project.
